For this project, I developed a simple and user-friendly Weather App using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the main development tool. VS Code provided an efficient environment with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time error detection, which made the development process smoother and more productive. The primary objective of this task was to create a web application that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve current weather information for that location using an external API.

To build the frontend of the application, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used to structure the web page, including elements like the input field, button, and display sections for weather data. CSS was used to style the application with a clean and modern look. I added features such as a centered card layout, rounded borders, shadows, and responsive design to ensure that the app looks good on different screen sizes. Additionally, I included external stylesheets from Google Fonts for custom typography and Animate.css for smooth animations when weather data appears.

For the core functionality, I wrote the logic using JavaScript, along with jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation and asynchronous API calls. When a user enters a city and clicks the "Get Weather" button, the app uses the fetch() function to send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, which returns current weather details such as temperature, description, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather condition. These values are then dynamically inserted into the web page using jQuery selectors like $('#temperature') and $('#description').

To display the current date and time, I used a JavaScript library called Moment.js. It helped format the timestamp into a human-readable format such as "August 5th 2025, 8:15:22 pm", adding a real-time feel to the app. The app also includes input validation and error handling. If a user enters an invalid city name, a message is shown to inform them that the city was not found, and the weather display section is hidden.

This Weather App project was a great learning experience for working with real-time APIs and handling JSON data in a practical context. It helped me understand how to structure a complete frontend project, apply asynchronous programming concepts, and make use of third-party libraries to enhance user experience. Overall, the project demonstrates the integration of various web development technologies and tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, VS Code, and the OpenWeatherMap API. It also gave me confidence in building interactive, data-driven web applications that communicate with external services.
